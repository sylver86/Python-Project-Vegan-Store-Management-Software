Title: Vegan Store Management Software in Python

## Description:

Welcome to the "Vegan Store Management Software" project, a text-based application for efficiently managing a vegan product store. 

This project involves creating software for managing a vegan product store. The software should have the following functionalities:

    - Register new products with name, quantity, selling price, and purchase price.
    - List all available products.
    - Record sales transactions.
    - Display gross and net profits.
    - Show a help menu with all available commands.

This software provides a range of features to streamline store operations:

### Key Features:

    Product Management: 
    Easily register new products with details such as name, quantity, purchase price, and selling price.

    Product Listing: 
    View a comprehensive list of all products in the store.

    Sales Registration: 
    Record sales transactions, keeping track of product quantities sold.

    Profit Calculation: 
    Calculate both gross and net profits, accounting for product costs.

    Command Menu: 
    An interactive command-line interface makes it simple to interact with the software.

### Project Guidelines:

    Code Structure: 
    The project emphasizes good code organization, including the use of functions to encapsulate different functionalities.

    Data Structures: 
    Thoughtful selection of data structures such as lists, dictionaries, or combinations thereof, to efficiently manage product data.

    Persistence: 
    The program ensures data persistence, retaining user input between program runs, by utilizing a text file with customizable encoding for data storage.

    Input Validation: 
    Robust input validation is in place, guaranteeing that numerical inputs are indeed numbers, and handling invalid cases with meaningful exceptions and error messages.

    Stock Verification: During purchases, the software checks whether the purchased products are in stock and provides an error message if not available.

    Stock Updates: When adding products to the stock, the software checks if the product is already in stock. If so, it updates the existing quantity without the need to re-enter purchase and selling prices.

    Profit Calculation: The software calculates gross profit as the total sales revenue and net profit as gross profit minus the cost of purchased products.
