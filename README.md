# Vegan Store Management Software in Python

🎯 **Project Objective:**

Welcome to the Vegan Store Management Software project, a Python-based text application designed to streamline operations in a vegan product store. This software aims to provide comprehensive tools for efficient product management, sales tracking, and profit calculation.

## Key Features

🔍 **Product Management:**
  - Facilitates the easy registration of new products, capturing essential details such as name, quantity, purchase price, and selling price.

🌟 **Product Listing:**
  - Offers a detailed view of all products available in the store, enhancing product visibility and accessibility.

💡 **Sales Registration:**
  - Keeps a precise record of sales transactions, maintaining an accurate count of product quantities sold.

💰 **Profit Calculation:**
  - Computes both gross and net profits to help assess the financial health of the business. Gross profit is calculated as total sales revenue, while net profit considers the cost of purchased products.

🖥️ **Command Menu:**
  - Utilizes an interactive command-line interface that guides the user through various commands and functionalities, simplifying software interaction.

## Project Guidelines

📊 **Code Structure:**
  - Prioritizes excellent code organization, using functions to segregate functionalities, thereby enhancing readability and maintainability.

📚 **Data Structures:**
  - Employs efficient data structures like lists and dictionaries to manage product data effectively, ensuring optimal performance.

💾 **Persistence:**
  - Ensures data persistence by storing user inputs and program states between runs using a text file, which supports customizable encoding for data storage.

🔒 **Input Validation:**
  - Implements robust input validation to ensure all numerical inputs are valid numbers and handles errors gracefully, providing useful feedback for recovery.

📦 **Stock Verification:**
  - Automatically verifies stock availability during purchase transactions and alerts if the desired quantity exceeds current stock levels.

🔄 **Stock Updates:**
  - Intelligently manages stock updates; if a product is already listed, the software simply adjusts the existing quantity rather than requiring re-entry of pricing details.

🧮 **Profit Tracking:**
  - Features advanced calculations for tracking gross and net profits, providing valuable insights into business operations and financial outcomes.
